[clock ticking continues]

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,200
[woman 1] Yeah?

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,800
[man] Zoom in. Zoom in a bit. A bit more.

10
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,680
Jerzy, I can't hear anything!

11
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
[chatter quiets down]

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
[woman 2] Excuse me, can I ask you
to make the prompter font bigger?

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,520
[woman 1] We are eleven seconds behind.

14
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,440
[sighs]

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,440
Welcome to the final TV call-in contest
this year and this millennium.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,840
Let us remind you of the prizes
the lucky winner will get.

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,320
[woman 1] More celebration,
smile and change your stance.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,040
We will all together welcome the year 2000
on this square which is so important…

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,240
[reporter] This year's igloo
was over three meters tall.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,520
The children were building it
for a few hours each day over two days.

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It's just a way to… fill some time
over the winter break, isn't it?

22
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,560
Well, we want to do something,
like, incredible.

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040

[indistinct chatter]

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
[man ] Hello.

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,960
-Stop, stop, stop!
-Hello Ms. Mira, welcome.

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
[Mira] I'm here!

29
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,160
Laura, you have to choose the shoes.

30
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
I couldn't decide.

31
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
What is this? Who gave it to her?
My New Year's dress.

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,240
Help me out.

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,120
[panting]
There's no time for the dressing room.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm sorry.
Do you know how much time this takes?

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,240
-[Laura] Mira--
-[man 1] More light on five!

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm sorry, I had a rehearsal
for New Year's Eve.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,160
I couldn't get out of the square.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,480
Mira, you're on call,
and you're getting paid for it, no?

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,720
[sighs] A contest on TV.
Don't be dramatic.

40
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
What is this?

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,640
Some kind of demonstration? Punishment?

42
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,400
-[Laura] A replacement.
-A replacement? For whom?

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,760
Sweetie, take it off.
We don't have much time.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
We're going live soon.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,840
-How much time left?
-[woman 2] I'll manage.

46
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
Four minutes.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
She's sulking.

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,000
And why did you bring her here?

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,920
-Which shoes?
-These.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,760
[man 2] Okay, are we ready?

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,120
All right, please go back to your places.
What are you looking at?

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,560
[man 2] Time to leave the set.
Please leave.

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,800
[breathes]

54
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,640
[Laura] Take your places!

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,880
-Let's start with two and three!
-[exhales]

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,560

57
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
[announcer] Telecontest.

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,560
[man 2] Camera one. Three…

59
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,440
Hello and welcome to the last
TV prize draw competition this year,

60
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,680
or even this millennium.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
[man 1] Easy.

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,800
-Slowly. You hear me?
-[man 2] Mm-hm.

63
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,960
[man 2] Good evening.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
[indistinct chatter]

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,920
[clock ticking]

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,880
[Mira] And now…

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,280
Stop!

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,680
And we have the name
of our potential winner.

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
Now a moment for me to focus,

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,520
so I don't misdial any numbers.

71
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
[phone ringing]

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,840
[Mira] And we're calling somewhere
far away, all the way to Sokołów Podlaski.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,840
One more moment of patience…

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
[contestant] Yes, hello?

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,120
-Hello?
-[contestant] Hello? I'm here.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,520
Good evening. This is Mira Kryle.

77
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
[contestant] How do you do?
Jadwiga Jeżewska.

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
[man 3] Get him out.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,280
[Mira] Nice to meet you.
I understand you're watching us.

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,320
-[man 3] We're live.
-[contestant] Yes, of course.

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
[Mira] So, what am I doing now?

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,800
-[man 3] We're live.
-[contestant] Waving at me.

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,960
[man 3] Don't let him in.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,360
-I'm waving at you. Good evening.
-[man 3] He's got a gun!

85
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,720
-[Mira] Unfortunately, I can't see that.
-[contestant] Halina! I won, see?

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,040
-[man 3] Duck!
-I'm sorry, we're…

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
[contestant] Hello?

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
[gunman] Don't move.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,120
[Laura] Switch, don't show him.
Hold on Mira.

90
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,280
We're having technical difficulties here.

91
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
[gunman] Stop!

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,240
-Don't move!
-[contestant] Hello?

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
[Laura] Play a tape.

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,160
-Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm here--
-[man 4] We've been taken off air.

95
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,040
-…because I'd like to talk.
-[contestant] Did I win the car?

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
-To imagine…
-[Mira] What the fuck is this?

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Jesus, Laura, is this some sort of joke?

98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,360
-You must be crazy!
-Stop, I said!

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
[contestant] Because there are…
some stripes here.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,520
They took us off air?

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Hm.

102
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,320
-[contestant] Hello!
-[gunman] Turn it on.

103
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,560
Turn the cameras on! Make it work!
You hear me? Turn the cameras on!

104
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
[Mira] It's them in the control room.

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
[contestant] And now some fireworks.

106
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,120
You need to talk to them… upstairs.

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
[contestant] Hello? Can you hear me?

108
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,920
[breathing heavily]

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Handcuff yourself to her.

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
[yelps]

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,720
[contestant] Hello, Miss Mira,
it's just that… I can't hear anything.

112
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,880
Miss Mira, stay calm.

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
-[yelps]
-[gunman] As tight as you can.

114
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,320
And… sit down!

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
Sit on your ass!

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,560
We're going live, get it?

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,920
[contestant] Who are you?

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Hello?

119
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Hello?

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Can you broadcast
on the main channel from here?

121
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,840
You can broadcast
to all of fucking Poland.

122
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,360
[contestant] Hello? Can you hear me?

123
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Marek?

124
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,160
Are you recording?

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,320
Put some tapes in and record all cameras.

126
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,360
[man 4] You're sending someone?
Yes, all right…

127
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,080
[contestant] I could hear you
a moment ago, and now I can't again.

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,320
Hello?

129
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Do what you have to give her that prize.

130
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,560
You won the grand prize.

131
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,800
[contestant] I won! See?

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,880
[chuckles] Well, Happy New Year!

133
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,520
All right, let's take it easy.

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,120
We're going live
unless you don't care about them.

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
[indistinct chatter]

136
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Nowacki from Security.

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,760
Building E. E as in Echo.

138
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,920
-The guard room can direct you.
-Take the cuffs off and give them to me.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,560
[Nowacki] We don't know how he came in.
Maybe he's specially trained.

140
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,080
-[gunman] Get a move on, take it off.
-Give me a minute.

141
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
Let me go.

142
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,640
[clattering]

143
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,680
[Nowacki] He didn't mention a ransom.

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
-[gunman] Hello!
-He wants to talk.

145
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,480
There's a microphone on the console.
You press the button…

146
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,760
This is totally not my job,
this kind of thing.

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,720
Armed assault.

148
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,040
We check IDs here.

149
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
[gunman] Hello?

150
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Is anyone there?

151
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,240
Hello? Can you hear me?

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,160
[Mira] Laura? [clears throat]

153
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
Hello!

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,400
Is anyone there?

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,560
I actually don't know.

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
[man 3] Quiet! Quiet!

157
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
Hello? [mic screeching]

158
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,480
Hello? Well, you were in no hurry.

159
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,440
-[mic screeching]
-[Laura] You need to move to the center.

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,400
What?

161
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,520
[Laura] When I turn on the mics,
and you're there,

162
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
it creates this screeching noise.

163
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,600
-[gunman] Who am I talking to?
-[Laura] The producer.

164
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
What? I can't hear you.

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,160
Producer Laura Kołodziej.

166
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,800
Do you have any demands?
What is this about?

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,400
Let's stop playing games.

168
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,560
Games?

169
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,080
Because this is fun for you?

170
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,560
-This is fun?
-[Laura] No!

171
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,760
-Is this fun?
-[Laura] Not at all.

172
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,800
Can we speak normally?

173
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,880
[man 3] Don't approach the windows.
Don't provoke him.

174
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,800
[gunman] All right, we'll talk normally.

175
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,000
He's coming here!
Get out, all of you! Now!

176
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
He's coming.

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,720
[man 2] Faster.

178
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,320
That's the proper reaction.

179
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
Let's start over.

180
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,000
[speaking louder]
Let's start again! Slowly, yes?

181
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,160
First of all, turn off those lights

182
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,760
and turn on some normal ones.

183
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,480
-What are you doing?
-[light switch shuts]

184
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
All right.

185
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,440
Get ready for my live appearance.

186
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,280
[Laura] It's impossible.
There's a schedule.

187
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,640
All right. I'll make a call.

188
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
Stop!

189
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Stop!

190
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,760
Stop!

191
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
[panting]

192
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,800
[sobbing] I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

193
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,640
I beg you. I won't do it… [crying]

194
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,880
[Laura] Just stay calm.

195
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
[Mira whimpering]

196
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,120
[Laura] Mira!

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,800
Sorry. I won't do it again.

198
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,680
[Laura] Sir,
please don't do anything to her.

199
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Fucking hell!

200
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,920
[thuds]

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,920
[Mira] I'm sorry.
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

202
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,480
[Laura] Please, sir,
don't do anything to her.

203
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,480
[gunman] Get up.

204
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
[Mira whimpering]

205
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,320
[Laura] Sir, please.

206
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,640
I can't do anything by myself here.

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,800
I need…

208
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,960
-Why do you want this? Tell me.
-I don't have to do anything.

209
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
[Laura] All right, how long?

210
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
A few minutes.

211
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,960
-[Laura] But what will you be doing?
-I don't know, singing.

212
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,760
I got eliminated from
A Chance for Success.

213
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
[Laura] All right.

214
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,240
All right, turn on whatever you need,
and let's go.

215
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,880
[Laura] I need time
to get a crew together.

216
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,000
A camera operator,
someone for sound and for lights.

217
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
Then get a move on.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,680
[Laura] All right, I'm making a call.
Just stay calm.

219
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
I am calm.

220
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
[Mira sobbing]

221
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
[sniffles]

222
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,960
Get in the car!

223
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
Get in the car!

224
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,320
[flashers blinking]

225
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,960
Are you in cahoots with him?

226
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't understand.

227
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,800
What do you two want?

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
What do you want?

229
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,240
But Miss Mira,
I've been working here for two years.

230
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,200
Last winter, when your car broke down,
I helped you out. Don't you remember?

231
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,960
Then why aren't you doing anything?

232
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,360
You need to keep calm and do what he says.

233
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,320
[gunman] Can you make
external calls from this phone?

234
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,480
Zero. Then the area code.

235
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
[car door closes]

236
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,600
[exhales]

237
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
[flashers blinking continues]

238
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,200
Move over to your side.

239
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
Move over.

240
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,520
[phone dialing]

241
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,000
[ringing]

242
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
[ringing]

243
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,200
[man 5] Hello?

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,080
[gunman] Dawid?

245
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,120
Hi, it's me.

246
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
[Dawid] Shit,
you weren't supposed to call me.

247
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,120
[gunman] I know, I get it.

248
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,200
[Dawid] Fine, say why you're calling.

249
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,040
[gunman breathing heavily]

250
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,080
[Dawid sighs]

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Fuck, say what this is about
and stop panting into the phone.

252
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,880
[gunman]
I just wanted to catch you before…

253
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,000
[Dawid] Catch?

254
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,000
[gunman] Just to send you my regards.

255
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,800
[Dawid sighs] You're crazy, really.

256
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,000
-I have to run, see you.
-No, wait. Wait. [hesitates]

257
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,360
[Dawid] Yeah?

258
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,800
Do you have a TV there?

259
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,240
[Dawid] TV?

260
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,840
Do you have a TV there or not?

261
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,320
[Dawid] Fuck, there is one.

262
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,480
Then watch it tonight.

263
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
[Dawid] What?

264
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
Sebastian?

265
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,960
Sebastian.

266
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,080
[announcer] Pessimists even claim
that on the first of January,

267
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,200
the banking system might collapse,

268
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,480
planes using computer navigation
might fall from the sky.

269
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,320
And in hospitals,
specialist equipment will stop working…

270
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,520
[medic] This is another thing
related to the Y2K effect.

271
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,880
Out of nerves, some apartments
were getting ready

272
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,000
almost for war conditions.

273
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,280
I saw piles of cans, packages of pasta,

274
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,840
boxes of candles, matches,

275
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,520
a supply of water kept in bathtubs,
pots and so on.

276
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,200
They claimed that something
would happen at midnight.

277
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,080
POLICE

278
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,880
[unsettling music playing]

279
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,400
Ready?

280
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes.

281
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,240
I'm the primary, you support.

282
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
You'll be fine.

283
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
Who's in charge?

284
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,800
[man 1] That's right.

285
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,480
Fire fighters? I don't know.
They might be here already.

286
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,480
Will you check?

287
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,840
We need ambulances to run the operation.
Should we deploy?

288
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,600
[sighs] On New Year's fucking Eve.

289
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,960
[Mira whimpering]

290
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,560
[Mira] Laura, can you hear me?

291
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,560
[Mira breathing heavily]

292
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,400
Laura, please…

293
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
[Sebastian] Get out.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,960
Get out!

295
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,280
[Mira] I have to call home.

296
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,080
I have a baby with a babysitter.

297
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,560
I should be home by now.
I was to take the baby to my mother.

298
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm a single mother.

299
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,880
-You're not calling anyone.
-One call, please.

300
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,880
[Sebastian] You're not calling anywhere,
okay?

301
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,360
Who are you?

302
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,200
Someone who doesn't respond
to emotional blackmail.

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
[walkie-talkie static]

304
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,040
[suspenseful music playing]

305
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,040
[Sebastian] Where's the operator?

306
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,360
[Laura] We are looking for someone
brave enough to enter the studio.

307
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
Let's give people some entertainment.

308
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,080
After all, the viewers are waiting.

309
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,800
[phone rings]

310
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,240
[phone rings]

311
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,280
[phone rings]

312
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,240
[phone rings]

313
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,520
Hello?

314
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,120
[man 1] Hi there, kid.

315
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,840
Congratulations,
beautiful entertainment. Well done!

316
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,960
Having fun? Is everything all right?

317
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,080
Listen, don't stress.

318
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,800
Put me on speaker.
I have a couple of words for Mira.

319
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,120
-Who's speaking?
-A fan from the crew!

320
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,160
Man, finally, something
is fucking happening in this studio.

321
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,320
Thank you very much.

322
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,680
Come on, listen, put me on speaker.
There's this big button there.

323
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,520
Put me through. Two words for Mira.

324
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,560
[on speaker] Mira?

325
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,920
Mira, wave to the camera
if you can hear me.

326
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,760
To show you can hear me…

327
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
Fucking hell, you're so dumb, aren't you?

328
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,760
I was wondering
if you'd fucking wave or not.

329
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,640
But without a smile?

330
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
For the viewers,
you have a fucking beautiful smile,

331
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
and what about your colleagues?

332
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,240
-Just fucking smile, won't you?
-[man 2] Do you recognize that voice?

333
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,640
-[man 1] Mira?
-No, I don't,

334
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
but he must be on TV grounds,
since he can see her.

335
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,400
Get the fuck out!

336
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
[swat 1] Did you get a look?

337
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,280
[officer] We're assuming
it's a live weapon.

338
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,720
The sniper is on position.

339
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Just in case, the glass is thick,
hard to tell how the bullet will fly.

340
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
You talk to him, and we'll get downstairs,
two shots in the hinges and assault.

341
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,080
We blow the joint.
One of them might go down, but maybe…

342
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,280
All right, take it easy.

343
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,080
Just be ready,
and we'll start negotiating.

344
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,120
[indistinct chatter]

345
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
-Will you start?
-[officer] Yes. Excuse me.

346
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,720
[man 1] You know we've been making bets?
Piotrek, Karol, Andrzej, Lusia

347
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,200
bet that he would
blow your fucking brains out,

348
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,160
-but the rest think he has no balls--

349
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,880
[phone rings]

350
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,600
[phone rings]

351
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,120
[Laura] Listen.

352
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,120
-It's the chairman for you.
-Excuse me, how do you use this?

353
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,080
Krzysztof Jedynak,

354
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,760
District Police Headquarters II Mokotów,
I'm listening.

355
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,680
This one here…

356
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,080
Hello. No, he's not here, I am.

357
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,720
[Laura]
…and this one you press only when talking.

358
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,360
[Jedynak] Are you trying to intimidate me?

359
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,800
Well, we're doing our job.

360
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
Are you ready?

361
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,000
-Yes.
-Then start.

362
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,440
Then make the call.

363
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080
[Mira] I understand you all
are having a lot of fun there?

364
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,000
You tapped into the mix feed,
and you're having some fun.

365
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
Like we're a movie.

366
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Should I wave?

367
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
Miserable bastards.

368
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,720
I mean, who even takes
a shift on New Year's Eve?

369
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
What's your name?

370
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,920
Grzegorz.

371
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,560
[officer] Hello, Sebastian.

372
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,680
My name is Piotr.

373
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm here to help you handle this matter.

374
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,360
Where's the other lady?

375
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,960
[Piotr] Miss Laura is here next to me.

376
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,400
Together we'll be getting

377
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,600
a camera operator for you.

378
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,200
I want to see you. Turn on the light.

379
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,200
[Piotr] Sebastian, please,
put the gun down. It's not necessary.

380
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,240
Please, do not point it at me.
It stresses me out. I'm scared.

381
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,640
As you should be.
Turn that fucking light on.

382
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,960
[Piotr] Sebastian, stay calm, please.
Put down your weapon.

383
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,160
Then I'll come to you.

384
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,440
[uneasy music playing]

385
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,560
Turn off the light!

386
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,440
Who the fuck is that?

387
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,400
[Piotr] Sebastian, Please, don't do that.

388
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,600
-Put the gun down.
-Turn that light on!

389
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,440
-[Piotr] Put the gun down.
-Turn the light on!

390
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,600
[Piotr] I'm begging you, put the gun down.

391
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,560
Stay here.

392
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,600
[Piotr] You threaten
an innocent person with a gun.

393
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
[Mira whimpers]

394
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,000
[Piotr] Sebastian, please.
Put the gun down.

395
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,080
We can talk calmly.

396
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,040
[Sebastian] Turn the light on!

397
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,840
-Can we turn the light on?
-[officer 1] Alpha ready.

398
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,360
[Jedynak] Stay in position.
Turning on the light.

399
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
[officer 2] Beta ready.

400
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
[speaking indistinctly]

401
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,880
Sebastian,

402
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,360
we did what you wanted.
Can you show yourself?

403
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,640
-Did they turn it on?
-[Grzesiek] Yes.

404
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
-Yes?
-[Grzesiek] Yes.

405
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,800
Now, what do you see?

406
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,440
[Grzesiek] Um…

407
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,920
[Sebastian] What do you see?

408
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,880
A lot of people.

409
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,560
And they're aiming at me.

410
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,000
Balaclavas, get the fuck out of there,
you hear me?

411
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,280
Pull everyone back.

412
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,160
-[Sebastian] Get the fuck out!
-Wait.

413
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,920
[Piotr] Sebastian, I can't see you.
Please show yourself.

414
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,600
Get out of there! Everyone get out!

415
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,320
They're still there.

416
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,680
I don't know how many there are,
about ten, eleven.

417
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,640
How many?

418
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,760
[Grzesiek] Ten, eleven,
with automatic weapons.

419
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,200
[panting]

420
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,560
Um…

421
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,000
Get the police out of here, please.

422
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,520
Get the police out of here
so that nobody is harmed.

423
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,200
All right, let's pull back. Pull back.

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,880
[Piotr] We're doing what you asked for.

425
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,720
The police are leaving now.

426
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
[breathing heavily]

427
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,360
[Piotr] Sebastian, I can't see you.

428
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
[Sebastian] You, in the middle, get up!

429
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,080
That's what I thought. Get the fuck out.

430
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,360
We're going live,
so we can finish this quickly.

431
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,400
The car.

432
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,680
The car! Grzesiek.

433
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,880
Push the car over here.

434
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,080
[panting]

435
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Put it in neutral.

436
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
Mira, move the cameras.

437
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,760
I can't see him.

438
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,400
Where is he?

439
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
Come here, inside the car.

440
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,200
-Talk. Get him out--
-Quiet,.

441
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,280
Sebastian, I understand
the sight of the police disturbed you.

442
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,240
I'm very sorry you got upset.

443
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,200
-Give us a moment to do what you asked.
-You have ten minutes!

444
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
[Piotr] Thank you very much.

445
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,040
[beep]

446
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
Come on, lend me your watch.

447
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,360
[flashers blinking]

448
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,800
[breathing heavily]

449
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,880
I'll give it back.

450
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,120
[Jedynak] We need to also be ready
to let him go live.

451
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,600
[Laura] And if he shoots Mira or the guard
in front of the TV audience,

452
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,080
or blows his brains out,

453
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,880
or screams, "gas the Jews,"
or does the Hitler salute?

454
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,880
Then we interrupt him or take him off.

455
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,200
No, it's not possible.

456
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,160
That's the end of it.
You don't do things like that on TV.

457
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,680
[indistinct chatter]

458
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,520
And even if you could,

459
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,080
it's not a decision you or I can make.

460
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,360
[unsettling music playing]

461
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,640
[Jedynak] They're interrogating
that Dawid guy that he called.

462
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,000
So far, we know the little shit
has no criminal record.

463
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,880
He studied at a technical university,
but he dropped out.

464
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,560
He lives with his mother.

465
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,400
-Only child.
-[Piotr] That's all?

466
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,360
That's all they managed to get out of him,
but they're still with him.

467
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,840
[Lena] Two minutes.

468
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880
He almost looks like an operator now.

469
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,320
[Piotr] I really don't recommend this.

470
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,240
-We'll just get another hostage.
-[officer] Beta is inside.

471
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
[Piotr] Let's do our job.

472
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,240
[Jedynak] Make sure they show him
how to use that camera.

473
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
[phone ringing]

474
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,680
Well? What do you mean he insists?

475
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
Then come on, bring him here but fast,
with the siren on.

476
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Thirty seconds.

477
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,800
[Sebastian] Time is up.

478
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,840
[Piotr] We managed to get you an operator.

479
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,200
Then where is he?

480
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,600
[Piotr] He's already on his way.

481
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,480
We are doing as you asked.
Could you let one of the hostages go?

482
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,680
No, you haven't done anything yet.

483
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,240
You haven't done anything yet.
Where the fuck are we? On TV?

484
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,680
There's nobody on site? How much longer?

485
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,920
[Piotr] It's not that easy.

486
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,160
Today is New Year's Eve.
Everyone is busy with the concert.

487
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,080
I'm fucking tired
of your fucking New Year's Eve. Get out.

488
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,000
[Piotr] Sebastian, you have a gun.

489
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,840
You need to understand
people are afraid to come into the studio.

490
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,040
Get out. In front of the cameras.

491
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,960
I'm sorry, but… I… just can't take hearing
one more word about an operator.

492
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,680
Nobody has to come in.
I can set it all up myself.

493
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,800
[Piotr] Miss Mira, I didn't hear you.

494
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,760
[Sebastian] Can she operate this?

495
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Is that true?

496
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,120
[Piotr] I don't know what Mira can do.

497
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,520
And I don't know what this man can do.
I don't know who he is. I've been…

498
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,320
I've been working here for 15 years.

499
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
I can…

500
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
explain everything to you. Can I?

501
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,360
They just need to put it on the air.

502
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,280
Go on.

503
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,560
Grzesiu, take a chair
and sit on the stage.

504
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,480
Miss Mira?

505
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,640
Do you need anything?

506
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,720
[Mira] When the camera is on,

507
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,080
you can see a red light.

508
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,640
We have…

509
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,920
four cameras.

510
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,280
One… wide, never mind. Two…

511
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,200
close-up. Three…

512
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,840
you're in down to the knees.

513
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,800
-Stop her somehow.
-[Piotr] How?

514
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,920
[Mira] This is the zoom.
There on the handle there's focus.

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,880
You just can't sit the way he does
because it looks bad, unprofessional.

516
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,240
Sit up straight.

517
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
Sit properly.

518
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,120
When they turn on the lights and cameras,
you might choke up a little bit.

519
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
It's a lot of pressure.

520
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,080
You need to be ready for that.

521
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,000
[inhales, exhales]

522
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,960
All right, then put me on the air.

523
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,680
[Jedynak] We'd have already been in there.
We'd have him.

524
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,560
All this "I don't recommend that…"

525
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,920
What the fuck do you actually recommend?

526
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,400
-First of all, to stay calm.
-[Sebastian] Put me on the air already!

527
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
Then answer him.

528
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,280
It's not that easy.

529
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,400
Sebastian, there's nobody here
who can make that decision.

530
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,920
Sebastian, put the gun down. I beg you.

531
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,760
The safety is off.
It could go off at any moment.

532
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,040
-I'm begging you.
-Will you find someone now?

533
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,960
[Piotr] Please, at least
put the safety on. There's nobody here…

534
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,240
-Only the chairman can make the decision.
-Then get the chairman.

535
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,080
[Piotr] We're doing everything
to get him as fast as possible.

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,240
-Please, put the gun down.
-How long till he gets here?

537
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,240
[Piotr] This could take a while.
He's not in Warsaw. He's on his way.

538
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,560
[whispering] Fuck.

539
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,080
Sebastian,

540
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,720
there's a way out of this.
Please, put the gun down.

541
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,960
Everything can go differently.
It's not too late.

542
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,080
Article 252

543
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,000
of the criminal code, section four.

544
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,920
"Who refrains from extortion

545
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,080
and frees the hostage is not punishable."

546
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,960
So, what? I should just lay down?

547
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,920
Give myself up?

548
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,080
Put the gun down. Yes.

549
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,040
[clicks tongue]

550
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,960
All right, but that's section four, right?

551
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,400
What about the other three?

552
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,520
[Piotr] Please, put the gun down.

553
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,240
Let's hear the first one.

554
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,880
[Piotr] "If someone takes a hostage,
it's punishable by three years in prison."

555
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,160
-The second one is irrelevant.
-[Sebastian] Let's hear the second.

556
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,960
"If it's accompanied by cruelty
 towards the hostage,

557
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,320
from three to 25 years."

558
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,960
But remember section four.

559
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,080
"If someone refrains from extortion
and releases the hostage,

560
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,480
they are not punishable."

561
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,960
I'm giving you a solution.

562
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,160
It's still not too late, Sebastian.

563
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
[inhales, exhales]

564
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,600
[Piotr] Sebastian.

565
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,080
[sighs]

566
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,600
[Piotr] Sebastian, let's get back
to our conversation.

567
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,720
We've managed to get so far together.

568
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,200
[exhales]

569
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Good, keep it going.

570
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,520
[Piotr] "Whoever refrains from extortion
is not punishable".

571
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,320
But you need to release a hostage.

572
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,200
[sniffs]

573
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,480
Sit down.

574
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,960
Then choose which one you want.

575
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,560
Choose!

576
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,040
I have a child.

577
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,680
How do you know he doesn't?

578
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,200
Do you?

579
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,760
I do.

580
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,400
[Sebastian] Decide!

581
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,880
[humming]

582
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,000
[Piotr] I hope that everyone

583
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,280
gets to go home safely today.

584
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah, especially me.

585
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,680
Decide. Choose one.

586
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,120
[gun cocks]

587
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,480
-[Sebastian] Ten, nine…
-[Piotr] Don't do this. Put the gun down.

588
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,320
-[Piotr] It's almost… We were almost…
-…eight, seven…

589
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,600
Sebastian, Mira, let Mira go.

590
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,160
-Please, let Miss Mira go.
-Sit down.

591
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,080
Sit.

592
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,000
[Piotr] Sebastian, you promised
you would let one person go.

593
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,560
No, I didn't promise anything.

594
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,640
I just asked you to choose.

595
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm done talking to you.

596
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,480
That's it.
Keep quiet until the chairman arrives.

597
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,360
-Sebastian, I'm very sorry that…
-Keep quiet until the chairman arrives!

598
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,880
What now?

599
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,280
So?

600
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,440
-We wait.
-How long?

601
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,560
Until he calms down.
I don't have a magic word.

602
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,800
I'm asking how long.

603
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,680
We might welcome the New Year here.

604
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,720
You must be kidding.

605
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,120
We're digging in. The guy is smart.

606
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,920
What are you doing here? Get out!

607
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,800
I see, he does what he wants with you.

608
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,360
-And that guy keeps thanking him.
-Those are procedures.

609
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,800
The perp needs to think he's on top,
in control.

610
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,840
But he can't really be in control of you.

611
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,440
-I can see Piotrek can't handle it.
-He had a tough time.

612
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,440
-When?
-Early December.

613
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,680
But he trained me.
He knows what he's doing.

614
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,800
Wasn't he the one dealing
with that gas tank in Wola?

615
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,600
Murder-suicide,
the guy blew up himself and his family?

616
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,880
Fuck.

617
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,840
-[officer] We have a guest at the front.
-I'm coming.

618
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,760
What's going on?

619
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,600
We're getting ready. Just a moment.

620
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,200
[announcer 1]
This is a one-of-a-kind evening and night,

621
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,480
like nothing you've ever experienced,
or ever will again.

622
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,640
Ladies and Gentlemen, congratulations
on not going anywhere tonight,

623
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,360
that you stayed home in front of your TV
because thanks to that, you…

624
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,840
He should speak plainly to the miners

625
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,480
who are gathered here.

626
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,400
In just a moment…

627
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,840
[announcer 2] Coming up,

628
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,680
the beginning
of our New Year's celebrations…

629
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,000
the band, Boney M!

630
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,760
[crowd cheering]

631
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,640
-[Jedynak] Please, have a seat.
-[man] Yes.

632
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,320
[Piotr] On these monitors you can see
what's going on in the studio.

633
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,480
Like we talked about.

634
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,880
You can talk about
any current issues you want.

635
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't worry, I'll be here next to you,
and we can stop any time.

636
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
[man] Yes.

637
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,000
Sebastian.

638
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,840
[Piotr] Sebastian, can you hear me?

639
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,640
There's someone
who would like to talk to you.

640
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,960
[Sebastian] I'm not talking to you!

641
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,200
He's not from the TV station.

642
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,200
He had nothing to do with it, you hear me?

643
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,920
Nothing at all. He knew nothing.

644
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,840
Dawid,

645
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,360
don't tell them anything, you hear?

646
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,880
You hear me, Dawid?
They have nothing on you, don't worry.

647
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
You'll be fine.

648
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,520
-Can you hear me?
-Sebastian… [clears throat]

649
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,000
Sebastian, it's me.

650
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,680
Can you hear me?

651
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
It's me.

652
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,360
[exhales]

653
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
[chuckles]

654
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,840
[exhales]

655
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,200
No way, I don't believe it.

656
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,920
Show yourself.

657
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,960
It's me.

658
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
That's perfect.

659
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,120
I see you've put on weight.
You're doing well.

660
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,600
Go home, you hear me?

661
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,400
Go home.

662
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,560
You don't need any of this.

663
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,680
I just want to help you.

664
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,800
[Sebastian] Whose idea was this?

665
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,800
God, the Father, spoke from the speaker?

666
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,360
Wrong address, I'm afraid.

667
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,120
Dad, go home, I beg you.

668
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,440
You don't need… Go back home…

669
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,080
Leave me here.

670
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,680
You don't have to be like that, really.

671
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,440
You already told me. We know.

672
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,680
What did I say?

673
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,440
What did I tell you?

674
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Where's Mom?

675
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,440
[father] She didn't want to.

676
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,520
When they came for me,
I thought something had happened to you.

677
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,800
And what did you feel?

678
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,200
What am I supposed to say now?

679
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,040
[Sebastian hesitates] Say what you feel.

680
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,160
Sebastian, we can stop this conversation
anytime you want.

681
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,920
[Sebastian] No, let… let me.
We'll have a conversation.

682
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,360
Can we?

683
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,000
Um…

684
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,960
[father] But let's talk normally.

685
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,040
All right? Normally.

686
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,960
Normally?

687
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,480
Did you take a look around you?

688
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,320
What do you mean normally?

689
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,360
How can I say this?
I'm kind of busy right now.

690
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,440
[father] Listen,
they are recording everything in here.

691
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,840
What do you need this for?

692
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,640
I don't know, as a… keepsake?

693
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,560
What keepsake?

694
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,040
[exhales]

695
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,000
Please. Just walk away.

696
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,280
[clicks lips]

697
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I can't.

698
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,400
Everyone here, you see…

699
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,160
came here for me.

700
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,280
The chairman is coming here.

701
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,960
I will be on live TV.

702
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
What? Aren't you proud of your boy
that he'll be on TV?

703
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,280
[father] That's enough.

704
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,520
[Sebastian] No? You can sit down
with your family in front of the telly.

705
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,120
Stop it.

706
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,640
Just stop showing off.

707
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
Stop clowning around.
You showed off enough.

708
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,240
-Excuse me.
-Fuck!

709
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,040
Leave that. Get out!

710
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,280
Get out! Move back!

711
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,640
Everyone, move back, I said.

712
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,000
Just take it easy, okay?

713
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,120
Very good.

714
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,760
-May I?
-Yes.

715
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,160
Son…

716
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm here.

717
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,280
[hesitates]

718
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,960
Where were you when they came for you?

719
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,840
[father] We were with our neighbors
for New Year's Eve.

720
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,160
Listen to me.

721
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,600
Let those people go,

722
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,120
the ones behind you, I mean…

723
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,840
I already talked to the policemen.

724
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,440
You can go to a hospital and…

725
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,240
You want to lock me up in a hospital?

726
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,600
Hey, tell me, how is your Dorotka doing?

727
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
Must be pissed?

728
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,760
What do you want?

729
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
Is this about me?

730
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,600
No. Try to imagine that this one time,
it's not about you.

731
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,040
Then what is this about?

732
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,600
Don't you know
what your mother is feeling right now?

733
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,880
You should leave mom out of this.

734
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,640
[father] They came to her first.

735
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,920
Your mother said
that she doesn't want to see

736
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
how her…

737
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,440
her only son…

738
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,520
Well, finish the sentence.

739
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,080
Or should I do it for you?

740
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,120
Do you really have no shame at all?

741
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,480
[Sebastian]
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

742
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,400
Really?

743
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,000
Did he stutter like that before now?

744
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,920
And on the air, live,
will you stutter like that as well?

745
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,200
-I mean, we have to stop it.
-[Jedynak] Quiet.

746
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,880
[father] What? Did you think of that?

747
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,000
What happens when you start
stuttering on TV?

748
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,080
And live?

749
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,360
Don't run away now.

750
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,760
Sebastian!

751
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,520
Have you forgotten already?

752
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,160
When we went to the clinic in…

753
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,120
um… to Warsaw?

754
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,520
He didn't say a word for six months!

755
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,360
And then training started,
something changed,

756
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,280
and the scanning speech began.

757
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,480
Did you forget that already?
"What did you eat, son?"

758
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,080
"I aaaaate…

759
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,800
aaa…

760
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,160
meeeat…

761
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,280
loaaaf. "

762
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,720
And you couldn't interrupt.

763
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,920
You had to calmly li… listen
until he was finished.

764
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,080
"What else did you eat? Tell me,

765
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,200
what else did you eat, son?"

766
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,480
"Iiii aaate aaaa saaalaaaad."

767
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,800
-"Aaaand I draaank the compoooote."
-Shut your face!

768
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,440
Sit down. Sit down. He's bottled
that up inside for a long time.

769
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,000
So, what? Now you're gonna s… sleep well?

770
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
[Sebastian] Uh…

771
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,560
A… And do you r… remember this?

772
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,200
[sobs]

773
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,840
F… first

774
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,800
pancake…

775
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,160
Fuck!

776
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,640
[breathing shakily]

777
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,560
[stutters]

778
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,840
F… fii… first pan…cake… i-i-is…

779
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,680
[stutters]

780
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,720
Always spoiled.

781
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,120
Let me fucking finish for once!

782
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,840
[Sebastian stutters]

783
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,040
Fi… Fiiirst pancake…

784
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,320
[exhales]

785
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,600
[voice trembling]
First pancake is always spoiled.

786
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,880
Remember?

787
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,320
You remember.

788
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,400
You'll like it in prison.

789
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
[crying]

790
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,640
You hear me?

791
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,000
In prison they'll…

792
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,840
In prison,

793
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
they'll knock
that sick lifestyle out of you

794
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,320
when they fuck you in the ass!

795
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,760
They'll knock that out of you in prison,
you'll see!

796
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,080
[crying]

797
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,760
[Lena] Come with me, this way.

798
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,880
-[Laura] How could you let that happen?
-Let what happen?

799
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,320
Stop talking to me like that. Understand?
See what happened?

800
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,320
Daddy came and the little shit crumbled.

801
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,520
He won't keep stringing us along.

802
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,480
[Piotr] You need to start listening
to my recommendations.

803
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
[Jedynak] It's my operation!

804
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,000
Didn't you ask to come here?

805
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,560
[Jedynak] Start controlling your emotions!

806
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,600
-[Piotr] We're both writing reports.
-[Jedynak] Report whatever you want.

807
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,520
[Piotr]
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

808
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,560
[Jedynak] Me neither.

809
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,040
The police came, started asking questions.

810
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,560
I had to see it for myself.

811
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,840
I thought maybe…

812
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,480
My father was very strict with me.

813
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,080
He had everything.

814
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,840
He quit university out of laziness.

815
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,080
What? Do you think I'm proud
that it turned out that…

816
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,800
That… it didn't work out…
My first time? That…

817
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,880
I always paid child support on time.
I was never late.

818
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,680
What can a 20-year-old know about…

819
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,240
children and life? Nothing, nothing.

820
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,040
"First pancake is always spoiled."

821
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,080
"First pancake is always spoiled,"
that's what I blurted out once

822
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,280
because he pissed me off.

823
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,240
You can see yourself
what kind of instigator he is.

824
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,040
I mean, every conversation
with him is some kind of…

825
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,200
[Lena] Do you think
your son could hurt someone?

826
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,160
I'm a little embarrassed by him now.

827
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,480
What were you asking? If what?

828
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,880
I asked if you think that your son
is capable of really hurting someone.

829
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,920
How should I know?

830
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,120
After all, I don't know that person.

831
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,280
We want money! Enough poverty!

832
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,360
[vocalizing]

833
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,760
We just feel like the people
of the last decade,

834
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,200
of the last millennium.

835
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,320
We've entered the new century.
We feel much older…

836
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,400
It's not difficult to say,
"We will give you more money."

837
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,560
It's difficult to say,
"We won't give you money."

838
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,960
Get up.

839
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,240
You're switching as I said.
You're in the chair now, kid, sit down.

840
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,000
Move the fuck to the other chair.

841
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,800
No discussion, I'm telling you.

842
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,400
What's going on?

843
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,800
You're the primary now.

844
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,600
-[Jedynak] Start talking to him.
-One moment.

845
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,960
No "one moment." We have no time, talk.

846
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,960
[exhales]

847
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,880
[switch turning on]

848
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
[Lena] Sebastian?

849
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,520
I wanted to apologize to you
for the situation with your father.

850
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,800
I admit that was a mistake.

851
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,840
He insisted on coming here.

852
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,680
We don't know you or him.

853
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,480
We shouldn't have done that.

854
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,320
[Jedynak] Where is he?

855
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,680
I also agreed to it.
That's why I'm apologizing, okay?

856
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,240
My name is Lena.

857
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,000
[Jedynak] Figure out where
the hostages are. I want to see them.

858
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,240
[Lena] Can you tell me how Miss Mira
and Mister Grzegorz are doing?

859
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,200
Miss Mira?

860
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,160
Mister Grzegorz?

861
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,120
We haven't seen you in a long time.

862
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,080
We understand you might not want to talk…

863
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,040
but we're just worried about you.

864
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,800
Maybe we could see you?

865
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Can this be turned around?

866
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,520
[Lena] Something's happening.

867
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,640
There they are.

868
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,000
[Jedynak] Where is that?

869
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,800
Here?

870
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,280
That's it?

871
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,320
[Lena] Thank you.

872
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,880
But…

873
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,800
it would be easier for me to talk to you
if I could see your face.

874
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,480
No, I think you've had

That this is something personal,
or you wouldn't have called Dawid.

933

[laughing]

1049
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,600
I almost didn't make it here.

1050
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,200
Today.

1051
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,680
But I fucking made it.

1052
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,840
Laura already brought…

1053
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,280
Kasia?

1054
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,720
-The weather girl?
-Miss Kasia. Miss Kasia Jaworska.

1055
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,920
They even gave her my fucking dress.

1056
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,720
You'd be sitting here with Kasia.

1057
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,280
[chuckling]

1058
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,760
-Stay close.
-[woman] I'll put a mic on you.

1059
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,000
We'll catch them in the corridor maybe.

1060
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,920
I don't really know, because if so, then…

1061
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,680
I ate dinner, and I was just finishing,
reading something,

1062
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,200
didn't hear anything.
Only later I found out…

1063
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,520
You know, someone
threatened someone else with a gun.

1064
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,240
Everything was ready for the millennium.

1065
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,640
The Christmas tree, the tables,
and suddenly, this whole thing,

1066
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,920
everything got moved.

1067
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,880
His aggressive behavior, his kind of…

1068
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,920
walking around like an animal in a cage,
which you could see on the cameras,

1069
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,840
it all seemed like
he was a little unstable.

1070
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,440
[Kasia] What did this man want to say
on New Year's Eve for the cameras?

1071
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,040
It must have been a desperate act.
It must be something important

1072
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,960
to take this kind of step.

1073
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,960
[indistinct chatter]

1074
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,960
[uneasy music playing]

1075
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,120
[Lena] Sebastian? Can you hear me?

1076
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,160
[Laura] Please try again.

1077
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,480
Sebastian?

1078
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,480
Good evening, Andrzej Kostecki,
the network chairman.

1079
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,120
Was this your idea?

1080
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,240
Great.

1081
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,840
-Miss Mi--
-Who's in charge, where is the commandant?

1082
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,960
-Miss Mira?
-[Andrzej] Which gentlemen did I talk to?

1083
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,720
-[Jedynak] Me.
-Mister Grzegorz?

1084
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,160
Can you hear me?

1085
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,240
Sebastian?

1086
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,840
-[Piotr] No connection.
-[Lena] Nothing.

1087
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,720
[Andrzej]
I want to know what the situation is.

1088
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,480
-[Piotr] In a moment. Be quiet.
-We have to.

1089
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,400
It's the chairman.

1090
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,600
[Lena] Sebastian, can you hear me?

1091
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,560
-No, they still can't hear me.
-[Piotr] Nothing.

1092
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,000
Sebastian?

1093
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,600
[Sebastian] We hear you. We hear you.

1094
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,800
So, you do have a signal.

1095
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,600
[Lena] Yes, I can see and hear you.

1096
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,560
I'm sorry that it took so long.

1097
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,320
Do you need anything?

1098
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,600
Water, food, medicine?

1099
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,280
No, you can get me the chairman.

1100
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,960
He was so outspoken
when he entered the studio. Let him talk.

1101
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,320
I can talk to him.

1102
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,600
[Sebastian] Go on, Kostecki.

1103
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,200
I don't think we have a choice.

1104
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,920
Please, sit down.

1105
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,000
[Sebastian] Is he shitfaced?

1106
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,160
He came straight from a New Year's party,
and you're afraid to let him talk?

1107
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,120
-[Andrzej] May I?
-[Lena] Yes.

1108
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,600
-[Andrzej clears throat]
-Hello?

1109
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,280
Hello. This is Andrzej Kostecki.

1110
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,840
Because of the bomb we had
to evacuate the entire building.

1111
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,000
We are in the next building.

1112
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,960
Mm-hm. You have a signal,
and everything's working. Can we start?

1113
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,960
Because we were waiting just for you.

1114
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,960
[Andrzej] Hmm… Well, we have to finish
all technical aspects.

1115
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,160
[Sebastian] Be quick
because you don't have much time.

1116
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,800
I'm going on after the president.

1117
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,440
Do you know when he's supposed to finish?

1118
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,840
Well… we don't know how long
the president's speech will take.

1119
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,400
Then find out!

1120
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,360
They do know.

1121
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,440
It's pre-taped.

1122
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,600
Andrzej, right?

1123
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,160
Right.

1124
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,280
[Sebastian] Listen, Andrzej,
stop fucking with me. All right?

1125
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,880
Because you don't have much choice.
It's the broadcast or them.

1126
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,920
But I can't make that decision alone.

1127
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,080
Why the fuck wouldn't you?

1128
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,840
-[Andrzej] I'll make a call and--
-Then what are you there for?

1129
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,320
-[Andrzej] Stay calm.
-Why the fuck were we waiting for you?

1130
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,400
What are you trying to pull?

1131
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,560
-Good evening, Mister Andrzej.
-[Andrzej] Good evening, Miss Mira.

1132
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,640
[Mira] I would really like to remain calm,
but I'm just losing my nerve.

1133
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,880
[Andrzej sighs] Yes, Miss Mira,
please trust me. Everything will be fine.

1134
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,680
[Mira] I'm trying.

1135
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,360
[Mira]
I understand everything, you know that.

1136
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,080
[inhales]

1137
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,680
I would just like to know what's going on.

1138
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,440
Miss Mira, please stay calm.

1139
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,640
These are police procedures.

1140
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,880
Well then, they fucking suck!

1141
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,800
Fuck,

1142
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,880
these procedures are shit.

1143
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,200
You left us here completely… alone.

1144
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,520
Do you know what that feels like?

1145
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,480
I would just like to know
if anyone there decided,

1146
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,880
"We're all getting the fuck out of there
and leaving Mira behind?"

1147
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,320
Has anyone thought about me?

1148
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,720
-Do you know what's it like to be…
-Miss Mira…

1149
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,040
…completely alone?

1150
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,040
[Andrzej] Miss Mira, stay calm.
We are all thinking about you.

1151
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,080
We care, really. Please remain calm
and don't get hysterical.

1152
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,200
[exhales]

1153
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,360
All right.

1154
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,960
All right.

1155
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,000
[sniffs]

1156
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,480
Or, I can just say fuck it all.

1157
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,280
[footsteps moving]

1158
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,920
Where has she gone?

1159
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,280
[line tone calling]

1160
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,880
Hi, Monika, this is Mira Kryle.

1161
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,880
[Monika] Hi. At least we can
talk on New Year's Eve.

1162
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,120
Where are you partying now?

1163
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,280
-The concert or…?
-[Mira] Listen…

1164
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,160
-Turn it off.
-[Mira] I'm calling on business.

1165
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,440
-Turn that off.
-I don't control it.

1166
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,280
Turn that fucking thing off.
Who do you work for?

1167
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,120
-[Mira] There is a hostage situation…
-Please just… fucking hell.

1168
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,840
-[Monika] Have you been drinking?
-[Mira] No, I'm not drunk.

1169
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,280
-He's next to me.
-[Jedynak] Who is she calling?

1170
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,920
[Monika] What are you talking about?

1171
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,240
-The competition.
-[Mira] Call whoever you want.

1172
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,160
Everyone's here.

1173
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,240
I bet they're listening. Andrzej's here.

1174
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,200
[sighs]

1175
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,720
You're the first one I called.

1176
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,400
Will you take it?

1177
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,200
She called because she's hysterical.

1178
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,960
I'm not going to the parking lot.
Tell them it's going well.

1179
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,760
We're just trying to deal with it.

1180
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,640
[Andrzej] How is it going well?

1181
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,120
-Arrest her. I know where he lives.
-[Jedynak] For what?

1182
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,040
[Andrzej] I don't know. Lack of
a fire extinguisher. Think of something.

1183
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,760
Andrzej Kostecki, yes?

1184
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,080
Yes, I was just talking to him.

1185
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,560
[phone rings]

1186
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,480
Can't you block that
through the TV council?

1187
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,560
[Mira] Wait.

1188
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,600
It will be live but an interview.
What do you say?

1189
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,960
Eh… Decide.

1190
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,480
[phone ringing]

1191
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,560
[different phone ringing]

1192
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,800
-[Monika] Give me one moment.
-[Mira] All right.

1193
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,240
[Monika] Can I call you back?

1194
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,200
-[Mira] Call main switchboard, then 501.
-[Monika] Sure.

1195
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,480
[Mira] Thanks, Monika. I'm waiting.

1196
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,960
Fuck. I hope it will be worth it.

1197
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,760
[sighs] If I were in your place, I'd have
started shooting a long time ago.

1198
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,440
[Lena] Sebastian, you've got it,
you hear me?

1199
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,200
Sebastian, you're going live.
With everything, sound…

1200
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,800
and video, you hear me?

1201
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,040
We're preparing the live broadcast.

1202
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,720
Just one more moment of patience,
all right?

1203
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,680
Miss Laura… will walk you
through the technical details.

1204
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:23,080
For the fifth, time we're meeting
on New Year's Eve.

1205
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,200
But for the first time,
we are meeting in such a unique moment,

1206
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,360
on the cusp of the symbolic year 2000.

1207
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,680
This kind of occasion happens once…

1208
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,480
Mister Grzegorz,
could you move it so I can see the face?

1209
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,960
I can see the gun.

1210
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,080
[President]
…counting time from the birth of Christ.

1211
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,920
Today we're building
a free and secure Poland.

1212
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,520
[Laura] A bit closer,
but don't cut the top of the head.

1213
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,920
[President] …and stable.

1214
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,480
[Laura] Sebastian,
could you take off the cap?

1215
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,600
I can't see your eyes.

1216
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,720
[President] …caring about its citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen…

1217
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,120
[Laura] Thank you.

1218
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,360
G-Grzegorz, c-could you move the TV?

1219
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,160
I would like to see myself.

1220
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,480
[sighs]

1221
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,280
I need to powder your face.
You're all sweaty. How long?

1222
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,040
[Laura] Two minutes.

1223
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,000
Right after the speech,
we'll put up a screen saying,

1224
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,400
"We interrupt this broadcast,"
and you can go.

1225
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,960
How long should my announcement be?

1226
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,160
-[Laura] Two, three sentences.
-I need to comb your hair.

1227
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,560
Something neutral like,
"We interrupt this broadcast

1228
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,080
for a special message," right?

1229
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,480
[Laura] Yes. Concise.

1230
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,480
One minute, 40 seconds.

1231
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,280
[President] The last day of the year
is always special.

1232
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,440
[Laura] Will you let him on the air?

1233
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,720
It's your job to make sure
we can see and hear it.

1234
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,720
It's part of your responsibility.

1235
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,240
[President]
…not just at the past 12 months…

1236
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,160
Excuse me.

1237
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,640
[President] …but all the passing years

1238
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,480
of our own lives,
our parents' and our children's.

1239
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,880
[Laura] Kołodziej.
Let's synchronize, okay?

1240
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,600
[President] Each one of us approaches
this occasion with humility…

1241
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,680
[Mira] Can we check my mic?

1242
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,160
One, two, three, four, five.

1243
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,840
-[Laura] Put it higher.
-[Mira] Higher?

1244
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,640
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

1245
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,440
One, one, one, one, one, one.

1246
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,120
One, one, one, one.

1247
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,200
[Laura] All right.

1248
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,320
One minute.

1249
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,760
Fix your hair at the back.

1250
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,440
-[Mira] The back?
-[Laura] Mm-hm.

1251
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,400
[Mira] Just two and three?

1252
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,840
Because my shoes are untied.

1253
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,320
[Laura] Don't worry.

1254
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,840
Two is the main one.

1255
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,320
Forty-five seconds.

1256
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,520
[Mira] All right. [sighs]

1257
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,240
I'll announce you,

1258
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,520
then step down from the stand,
and you stand right where I was.

1259
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
Okay?

1260
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,720
-You can read from the cards.
-Please don't talk to me for a while.

1261
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,480
[President]
I know not everyone has a chance

1262
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,960
to spend this evening
the way they would like.

1263
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,800
To those people especially
I send my warmest wishes

1264
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,120
for luck and personal success.

1265
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,120
In these wishes,
I remember all of those people,

1266
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,640
who through their hard work
create our reality.

1267
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,800
About working people,
entrepreneurs, scholars,

1268
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,400
teachers, artists, doctors and nurses,

1269
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,720
priests, local government workers
and community workers.

1270
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,640
There's more and more of us in this world.

1271
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,360
The recipe for success is to live wisely,

1272
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,320
in harmony with the world,

1273
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,200
in peace and friendship with others.

1274
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,760
Let's remember the world
is not the property of those who govern,

1275
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,040
or those who rule by force,

1276
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,120
or those who make their fortunes,

1277
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,440
-or those with the best education.
-[Laura] Hello?

1278
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,040
-Turn it off, please.
-[President] It belongs to everyone.

1279
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,320
Let's be happy to greet the 21st century.

1280
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,360
It is a great challenge,
but also a great chance…

1281
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,720
[Laura] You're live in 15 seconds.

1282
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,360
[unsettling music playing]

1283
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,200
[Laura] Nine.

1284
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,480
Eight.

1285
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,800
Seven.

1286
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,880
Six.

1287
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,040
Five.

1288
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,120
Four.

1289
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,240
Three.

1290
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,200
Two.

1291
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,640
[sighs]

1292
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,080
Welcome to a special edition
of our program.

1293
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,560
Mira Kryle, welcome.

1294
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,120
There are moments for which even we,
the TV people, are not ready.

1295
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,400
We interrupt our scheduled program

1296
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,680
-to broadcast a special message…
-[Grzegorz] Nothing.

1297
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,480
-[gasps] It's live. [moans]
-No, it fucking isn't. Come here.

1298
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,200
-Sebastian, no.
-[Sebastian] You thought I wouldn't check?

1299
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,400
-It's not on?
-No!

1300
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,560
[Lena] Sebastian--

1301
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,640
[thuds]

1302
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,240
-Now!
-[thud]

1303
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,720
[pants]

1304
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,440
[Sebastian] The light!

1305
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,640
Turn on the light!

1306
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,520
Grzesiek, Mira, on the floor!

1307
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,520
Mira, on the floor!

1308
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,800
Mira!

1309
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,400
-[thuds]
-[shouts]

1310
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,880
[breathing heavily]

1311
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,960
[grunts]

1312
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,320
-[groans]
-[Lena] Sebastian, what's going on?

1313
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,440
Fuck me.

1314
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:28,360
[Mira] No!

1315
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,720
[whimpering, crying]

1316
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,520
Stop the assault. Turn the lights on.

1317
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,520
-Did you know about this?
-[Jedynak] Do something.

1318
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,640
[Andrzej] What are they doing?
What the fuck is this?

1319
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,240
-[Jedynak] Get those people out!
-Quiet!

1320
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,760
-What the fuck is this?
-Quiet!

1321
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,840
[screaming]

1322
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,400
[Lena] Sebastian?

1323
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,640
Please, tell me what happened, all right?

1324
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,440
Grzegorz, take the first aid kit.

1325
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,200
[Lena] Can you hear me?
Stay calm, please, tell me.

1326
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,040
We have a doctor here. Can you hear me?

1327
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,600
-[Grzesiek] Fucking hell! Empty!
-[whimpering]

1328
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,760
[Lena] Miss Mira!

1329
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,080
If…

1330
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,800
[Grzesiek]
She needs to go to the hospital.

1331
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,520
[Lena] If something's happened,
please tell me, okay?

1332
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,200
[Mira whimpering]

1333
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,000
[Lena] Sebastian, if you need a doctor…

1334
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,400
-[Grzesiek] You hear?
-[sobbing]

1335
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,520
This is your fault.

1336
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,480
Sebastian!

1337
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,360
This is your fault!

1338
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,120
[clamoring]

1339
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,080
Stay calm, please.

1340
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,280
-Tell me what's happened, okay?
-[Sebastian] It's your fault!

1341
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,520
I really don't know
what to say to him now.

1342
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,880
-What are you doing?
-I'm going in.

1343
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,920
-What will you tell him?
-[Jedynak] I'll improvise.

1344
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
-My ass is on the line anyway.
-[Piotr] Who will be in command?

1345
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,000
[Mira crying] Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

1346
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,200
[breathing heavily]

1347
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
[man] Let him through.

1348
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,960
[reporter] Film him. Film him.
Film him. Film him.

1349
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
[moaning]

1350
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,760
-[crying]
-[Sebastian] Mira, stay calm.

1351
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,760
[stutters] I'm sure you have insurance.
You will get some money out of it.

1352
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,400
-Mira.
-Get away from…

1353
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,160
[crying]

1354
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,920
[knocking]

1355
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,200
-[Jedynak] I'm alone. I'm unarmed!
-Hands in the air.

1356
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:01,640
[Mira moaning]

1357
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,800
I've brought water.

1358
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,760
Can I see Miss Mira?

1359
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,880
I'll open this a little.

1360
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,440
Slowly.

1361
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,440
Oh fuck.

1362
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,880
I'm going to crouch.

1363
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,680
-[Mira whimpering]
-Everything will be fine. Take it easy.

1364
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,840
[moaning]

1365
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,760
[Jedynak] Listen.

1366
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,000
It's all gone too far.

1367
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:32,960
Let her go.

1368
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,000
Let's do it like that: I'll take her,
and she's not your problem anymore.

1369
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,600
And you still have someone left, right?

1370
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,680
Take her.

1371
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,760
[grunts]

1372
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,400
-Easy. One more time.
-[screams, groans]

1373
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,440
-[Mira] No, no, no, no!
-Fuck. Okay, take it easy.

1374
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,800
[whimpering in pain]

1375
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,840
I'm coming in. I have to come in.

1376
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,480
-Stop. Stop, I said!
-[Jedynak] Check it out.

1377
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,080
I don't have a gun.
I'm clean. Take it easy.

1378
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,400
Lower your weapon.

1379
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,600
I'll take a chair, all right?

1380
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,320
-Okay, take it and fuck off, you hear?
-Will you help me?

1381
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,520
[Sebastian] Help him.

1382
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,160
[Mira gasps, breathes heavily]

1383
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,440
-No, no, no!
-[Jedynak] Easy.

this is Andrzej Kostecki, the chairman.

1426

You had to know it wouldn't be so easy

to get on TV just like that.

1428
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,400

You can't let this opportunity
go to waste.

01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,640
But that, of course,
depends on what you say…

Sebastian.

1439
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,400
Don't just think about yourself.
Think about all those young people

1440
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,440

1441
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,640
